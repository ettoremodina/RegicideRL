Summary of ActorCriticPolicy Updates for Discard Pile Integration

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate discard pile information 
into the ActorCriticPolicy for PPO training.

CHANGES MADE:
============

1. ActorCriticPolicy.__init__():
   - Updated card_embed_dim default from 64 to 12 to match CardAwarePolicy
   - Updated critic input dimension calculation to account for discard pile encoder output
   - New context_input_dim = card_embed_dim * 2 + game_state_dim
   - game_state_dim = 12 (6 from game_state_encoder + 6 from discard_pile_encoder)

2. ActorCriticPolicy.get_features():
   - Added discard_pile tensor processing with proper batch dimension handling
   - Added discard_context computation using actor.discard_pile_encoder
   - Updated combined_context to include discard_context:
     combined_context = [hand_context, enemy_embedding, game_context, discard_context]
   - Fixed enemy_embedding to use actor.enemy_embedding instead of actor.card_embedding

3. main() function:
   - Updated card_embed_dim parameter from 64 to 12 to match CardAwarePolicy

ARCHITECTURE FLOW:
=================

Input Observation:
- hand_cards: (max_hand_size,) tensor of card indices
- game_state: (12,) tensor of game features  
- discard_pile_cards: (54,) boolean tensor indicating which cards are discarded
- enemy_card: scalar tensor of enemy card index
- + other fields (hand_size, action_mask, etc.)

Feature Processing:
1. hand_cards → card_embedding → hand_context (12 dims)
2. enemy_card → enemy_embedding → enemy_context (12 dims)  
3. game_state → game_state_encoder → game_context (6 dims)
4. discard_pile_cards → discard_pile_encoder → discard_context (6 dims)

Combined Context: (36 dims total)
[hand_context(12) + enemy_context(12) + game_context(6) + discard_context(6)]

This combined context is used by both:
- Actor: combined_context → context_encoder → action scoring
- Critic: combined_context → critic network → value estimate

BENEFITS:
=========

1. The policy now has access to complete discard pile information
2. Can make more informed decisions based on which cards have been played
3. Better strategic planning (knowing what cards are no longer available)
4. Improved value estimation with full game state information

COMPATIBILITY:
=============

- Fully compatible with existing PPO training pipeline
- Maintains same interface for get_action_and_value()
- Checkpoint saving includes correct model configuration
- Works with both single observations and batched observations

TESTING:
=======

A test script (test_actor_critic_update.py) has been created to verify:
- Forward pass works with new observation format
- Feature dimensions are correct (36 dims as expected)
- Actor and critic both function properly
- Integration with environment works correctly
